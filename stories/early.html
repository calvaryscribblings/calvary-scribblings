                    ← Back to Short Stories
                </a>
                <div style="font-size:1.25rem;line-height:2;color:var(--dark-gray);">
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">It's half past three in the morning when I open my eyes and find myself staring at the clock quietly blinking its digital seconds at the head of our bed. I smile wickedly to myself as memory, without the slightest strain, takes me back to hours earlier — a night filled with breathless sex and tender loving. I turn and feel my naked skin brush against Jerry's. He stirs but doesn't wake. I watch his peaceful face and feel the familiar pull of desire.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Determined not to disturb him yet, I let my mind drift back to the first time.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">We were only three months into our long-distance relationship when he flew into town to be with me. By then, shuttling between cities had become routine — exhausting but necessary. The distance tested us constantly, but we were determined to make it work.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">That particular afternoon, I knew something was different the moment I walked into his hotel room. His pupils were wide — hunger mixed with worry, nervousness tangled with desire. He had something on his mind, but I didn't press. I wanted him to come to me when he was ready.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Wearing only a white polo and shorts, he moved to the refrigerator. 'Anything to drink?' he asked, glancing back with a tentative smile.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">'Water's fine.' I smiled and settled onto the bed, smoothing my baby-pink flare skirt beneath me.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">He poured my water and a half-glass of scotch for himself, then handed me the glass before retreating to the only chair in the room.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">'You are a very attractive woman, Nora,' he began. So this was it — he was finally ready. He took a sip, his shoulders easing slightly. 'I'm not one to pressure anyone or make a woman go against her will.' The smile had vanished from his face.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">'So what are you saying?' The words left my mouth before I'd even decided to speak. His presence had always done that to me — pulled responses from some unguarded place.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">'I'm saying that I find you extremely attractive. And I know you feel the same way about me.' He paused, holding my gaze. 'I would like for us to explore this attraction. More than anything.'</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">If there was one thing I loved about Jerry, it was his way with words — deliberate, careful, devastatingly precise.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">His eyes never left mine. And under that steady gaze, I felt my certainty waver. His calm seduction was building something in me — a hunger I hadn't known I possessed.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">I knew what he was asking, but I wanted him to say it plainly. I drained the last of my water, crossed the room to set the glass down, then walked to him and settled onto his lap. Our eyes were level now. I lowered my head and pressed my lips to his, deepening the kiss immediately. He matched my pressure exactly — God, the way he used his mouth.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">I pulled back just enough to ask, 'Jerry, tell me. What do you want?'</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">He swallowed hard. 'I want you.'</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">'You have me.'</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">'I know.' He understood I needed more. 'I want to peel those clothes off your body.' His voice remained calm, controlled — which only made it more potent.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">'What else?'</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">'I want to watch you come undone beneath me. Above me. Beside me. I want you shattering into a million pieces from my touch.'</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Heat pooled between my legs. 'And?' My voice was weakening, consumed by need.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">'I want to hear you call my name while I memorize every inch of your body.'</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">He knew exactly what to say. When to say it. How.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">I couldn't wait anymore. 'Take me to the bed.'</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">We had never had sex. I had never had sex with anyone. Jerry was about to be my first.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">The combination of his tongue and hands on my bare skin drove me to the edge of reason. He brought a beautiful agony with every touch — gentle, patient, achingly thorough. He took control, and with his mouth alone, he took me to places I never knew existed while lying in that bed. Inch by deliberate inch, he learned me.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">I lost all control when his tongue found its way between my thighs.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">My breathless moan was all it took.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">Lying in our bed now, thinking about that cold December afternoon, I feel the dampness return. I glance at my husband beside me and decide he's slept long enough.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">I slip beneath the covers and quietly, hungrily, take him into my mouth.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">His sleepy moan is all it takes.</p>
